Props helps one to pass information from parent component down to child components but the other way around ,i.e. passing data from child to parent is not handled by default react due to a very justified reason that if something goes off in App component(parent) then to our relief, we will at least be sure that none of it's child could be responsible for it since no interaction happens in that direction(child->parent).Interaction is just one way that too from parent to child.Hence child components are unawared of who is rendering them, doesn't care who is rendering them and doesn't interact with it's parent ever.Though we can do achieve interaction from child to parent too, if needed.
